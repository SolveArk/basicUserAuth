# basicUserAuth
***A very basic authentication program using php session***

This is a simple user authentication program that i used in demonstrating how php session works,
The program is able to store a user's validated data on user registration and loses this data when the user
either logs-out, which destroys/unsets user data or when the browser is closed...
